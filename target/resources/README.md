SPINUA-Step FD: Patch Processing and Final Delivery

Selection of one or more patches within the AOI and generation of the displacement maps.
This will involve the identification of the position of additional PSC by exploiting the phase of the SAR interferograms; Atmospheric Phase Screen Estimation and Removal; Inter-Image Analysis and estimation of velocity/dem-error after APS removal; Displacement Trend generation and conversion to KML and SHP formats. All these steps are performed for each patch selected by the user.
